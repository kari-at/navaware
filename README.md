## Explanation of files in 'Prototype code'
#### Puppeteer iPad
`accessiphone.py` `main-puppeteer.py` `main-puppeteer.pyui`are the main and essential files needed for the prototype to function. `envdes_en.txt` `envdes_nl.txt` `struct_en.txt` `struct_nl.txt` `map.jpg` is also necessary to recreate the prototype. However, these files can be edited to change the content of the prototype. The IP address needs to be changed in order to establish a connection with the puppet (iPhone).
* `accessiphone.py` Library of python functions to access built-in functions on iOS (e.g. text-to-speech engine, vibration motor, etc.)
* `annotateExplore.csv` Autogenerated csv file that records when the annotation toggles were activated (not used)
* `annotateOther.csv` Autogenerated csv file that records when the annotation toggles were activated (not used)
* `annotateWalk.csv` Autogenerated csv file that records when the annotation toggles were activated (not used)
* `envdes_en.txt` Prepared 'environmental descriptions' of the route in English (text is imported and displayed in the table of the UI)
* `envdes_nl.txt` Prepared 'environmental descriptions' of the route in Dutch (text is imported and displayed in the text field of the UI)
* `logPushPullInfo.csv` Autogenerated csv file that logs the timestamp of requested information.
* `main-puppeteer.py` Main file
* `main-puppeteer.pyui` Main UI file
* `map.jpg` Map that is imported into the UI
* `ping_bing.wav` Optional sound file for extra notification sounds
* `struct_en.txt` Prepared 'common street structures' of the route in English (text is imported and displayed in the table of the UI)
* `struct_nl.txt` Prepared 'common street structures' of the route in Dutch (text is imported and displayed in the text field of the UI)
#### User iPhone
`accessiphone.py` `main-user.py` are the main and essential files needed for the prototype to function. The IP address needs to be changed in order to establish a connection with the controller (iPad).
* `accessiphone.py` Library of python functions to access built-in functions on iOS (e.g. text-to-speech engine, vibration motor, etc.)
* `main-user.py` Main file
* `ping_bing.wav` Optional sound file for extra notification sounds
